#Question I'm trying to answer: At what point should a team decide to "blow up" its roster?
Q1: I think maybe you could do this by plotting performance and trades to show if there's a point *when teams have decided to blow up its roster*. Is there any pattern to that? I think that's probably doable whereas predicting player performance if they hadn't been traded might be more complicated, but curious what your reaction is.

#Does that data already exist? Can you get it?

#Do you need assistance in getting it?

#What time frame do you want/need data from?

#Will you have to improve or augment the data in order to answer your question? If so, how?

#Are there other examples of this kind of work (specific or general)? If so, provide them.

If your data is available and you have it, create code blocks to load the appropriate libraries and then read in the data.
